# Note-Taker
Note Taker uses a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, and the fs, express and path node modules to create an application that can take in note title and content input, store it in a json file to act as a database, and render the note on the screen in a list of notes. You can view previously saved notes, create new notes or delete notes. Due to the use of the json file notes will persist through refresh of the page
