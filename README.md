# Note-Taker
Note Taker uses a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript Node.js, and the fs, express and path node modules to create an application that can take a note title and content input and render the note on the screen in a list of notes. You can create new notes or delete notes. This application uses a db.json file to act as a database to store the notes through refresh, and Heroku to host the website.
